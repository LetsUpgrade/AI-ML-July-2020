Step 1: Formulation of Hypothesis
H0 -> There is no significant correlation between Attitude and Duration(r=0)
Ha -> There is significant correlation between Attitude and Duration(r !=0)

Step 2: Select the appropriate test
T -test

Step 3: Level of Significance and Degree of Freedom(n-2)
Alpha = 0.05 -> 5% error and remaining 95% accuracy

Step 4: Calculating the test value -> CV = 8.144

Step 5: Calculate the Table value -> TV = 2.228

Step 6: Compare the CV and TV

Step 7: Hypothesis Conclusion
TV > CV -> Accept H0 
CV > TV -> Reject H0
